Subject: remove j9stub

Apparently the Java 9 stub file is not needed because we use OpenJDK8?

Fix a FTBFS due to
/build/lombok-1.16.22/src/j9stubs/org/mapstruct/ap/spi/AstModifyingAnnotationProcessor.java:21: error:
package javax.lang.model.type is not visible
[ivy:compile] import javax.lang.model.type.TypeMirror;
[ivy:compile]                        ^
[ivy:compile]   (package javax.lang.model.type is declared in module java.compiler, but module
             org.objectweb.asm does not read it)
